            <h2>All about me!</h2>
            <p>I went to New York for vacation this summer! We roamed around Times Square all night and only left at around 4 in the morning! it was really fun, but tiring.</p>
            <p>People think I'm the quiet girl who doesnt talk much, but I'm the opposite of that! I'm really crazy and act really stupid:)</p>
            <p>I have no pets sadly, but we did have fish. I really want a siberian husky though!</p>
            <p>I honestly don't know what to write at this point...</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
